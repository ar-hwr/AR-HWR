# AR-HWR - Mobile Anwendungen

Install Unity Hub, never Unity directly!
In Unity Hub, switch to Installs and download Unity 2018.3.xxx
Never upgrade a project through an oversight! Unity will ask you again if you really want to open the project with a different version, no, you don't want that!
When installing Unity, make sure you check
- Android Build Support
- UWP Build Support (IL2CPP)
- Vuforia Augmented Reality Support
- Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)
- UWP Build Support (.NET)
- Documentation


Also install Blender on the same computer, otherwise you wont see the models, imported directly as .blend files


Be prepared with Android AVD (Android 7.0 upwards) or a device with same specs.
I dont recommend Windows as primary target as webcams of tablets/notebooks are not as good as these of smartphones.
